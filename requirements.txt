In a previous semester, one of our customers presented a request for a listing which
contains a linked list of their customers in alphabetical order and they were
disappointed when they received a stack list program of their customers.
What they want is for the list to retain the names of their customers in
alphabetical order.

At this point, we are not to be concerned with the contents of the customersâ€™
information.

For example, if they have the following list of names:

Jones, Smith, Duggan and Alpha,

they wish to have the list to be kept in alphabetic order:

Alpha, Duggan, Jones, Smith.

Also, when a fifth customer named Morris is added to the list,
the list would display as follows:

Alpha, Duggan, Jones, Morris, Smith.

When a sixth customer, Wynn, is added the list would display:

Alpha, Duggan, Jones, Morris, Smith, Wynn.

When a seventh customer, Adams, is added the list would display:

Adams, Alpha, Duggan, Jones, Morris, Smith, Wynn.

These names and additional names are to be kept in alphabetical order
in the list by customer name.

Deletions and modifications are not required at this time.

Please be aware that it will be beneficial to write your program in such
a way that it maintains the alphabetical order of the list from the first
member entered, one by one,until the last member is entered.
